# Implementation Guides

Feature-specific tutorials and complete code examples.

## Available Guides

### SDK Integration
- [**WordPress SDK**](core-wordpress-sdk.md) - WordPress REST API integration patterns
- [**LM Studio SDK**](lm-studio-sdk.md) - Local AI model integration and usage

### Planning & Process
- [**Writing Plans**](writing-plans.md) - How to write technical implementation plans
- [**Directory Structure**](directory-structure.md) - Documentation directory organization and purpose

## Guide vs Plan

**Plans** (in `docs/plans/`) define **WHAT** to build:
- Task breakdown with Definition of Done
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Time estimates and dependencies

**Guides** (this directory) show **HOW** to build:
- Complete code examples
- Best practices and patterns
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**Example:**
- **Plan:** "Implement LM Studio SDK with chat completion endpoint"
- **Guide:** Full working code for chat completion with all parameters

## Contributing

When creating a new guide:
1. Use clear, action-oriented title: "How to X", "Writing Y", "Implementing Z"
2. Include complete code examples with expected output
3. Show both success and error cases
4. Link to related architecture docs and existing guides
5. Add entry to this README with brief description
